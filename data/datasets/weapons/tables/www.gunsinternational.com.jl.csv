These will also fit the current production fifteen round Mec-Gar magazines numbers SW5915B and SW5915N. They will NOT work for Mec-Gar numbers 5910 and 5917, however. The tail pieces are different from the factory mags on the tens and seventeen rounders made by Mec-Gar, but the Mec-Gar fifteens are the same as the factory Smith  Wessons. No One regards the 6900 Smith  Wessons more highly than we do, but their compactness renders them less than ergonomic for protracted firing sessions, especially for folks like some of us with hands like Gatemouth Browns. These outfits have always been popular with law enforcement officers who carry them for backup in tactical situations, like drug agents who use the full capacity 6906 6946 type compacts and then have larger, but good feeling extra magazines. The adapters themselves are still manufactured by our old friends at Precision Gun Specialties; and they are relatively easy to install. We just remove the floorplate, install the adapter sleeve, and then slide in the PGS replacement floorplate. These adapters also work on 4000 series magazines, 4006 and 4003 mags, to fit into some variants of the 4013TSW and similar; the .40 compacts, though, have to be the ones capable of accepting double stacked magazines, not the single stacked ones like the old 4013 variants. Its literally just a snap to put one of these on the longer magazines. Single adapter price is $25.00. Were offering the adapters separately, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $19 each.
