It comes with the complete AA kit plus the full BCG and a pistol length drive rod, the ID of the gas block is .750""    This design of this piston system is just incredible, especially when shot suppressed. It has 5 different gas settings for numerous applications (ie, subsonic) and is unique in that it can fit under most handguards that use a standard barrel nut, instead of having the block poking up in front of the handguard and disrupting the profile. It also is legitimately self-cleaning, and designed to shoot around 10,000 rounds before requiring to be cleaned.
